* Works for all actions: approve/reject/needs_info.
* Keeps data centralized in one model.

*Step 3: Save Feedback Together With Status*

* Update status and feedback in the same submission.
* Prevents mismatch where status changes but feedback not saved.
* Reduces number of clicks.
* Matches assignment workflow: decide + write feedback in one action.
* Ensures atomic feel in prototype.
* Keeps system simple and stable.

*Step 4: Confirm After Save*

* Redirect to dashboard and reopen modal to confirm feedback displayed.
* Ensures lecturer sees their input was saved.
* Prevents repeated typing due to uncertainty.
* Confirms DB update succeeded.
* Supports demo reliability.
* Supports “final time to work” stability.

*Step 5: Handle Validation Lightly*

* Prototype allows empty feedback (not blocking decision).
* Still encourages lecturer to write it as best practice.
* If you want: add “required” only for Reject or Needs Info.
* This can be added with minimal extra logic.
* Keeps UI smooth and avoids blocking during demo.
* Maintains consistent simple prototype behavior.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03hkw:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93388,BSSEF25T9-162,Lecturer – Add Decision Comments / Feedback,Done,10/Jan/26 11:24 AM

* Add {{<textarea>}} labeled clearly “Lecturer Feedback”.
* Place it near decision buttons so workflow is natural.
* Allow multiple lines for detailed comments.
* Ensure it’s not hidden by CSS.
* Provide placeholder text for clarity.
* Ensure it is readable (font size and padding).

*Step 2: Pre-fill Existing Feedback*

* If request already has lecturer_feedback, show it in the textarea.
* Prevents losing previous reasoning.
* Allows lecturer to update feedback if needed.
* Confirms DB data is being pulled correctly.
* Keeps UI consistent with stored records.
* Makes it feel like a real admin tool.

*Step 3: Add Field Name for POST*

* Ensure textarea has correct name attribute (e.g., {{name=""lecturer_feedback""}}).
* Backend reads POST key matching that name.
* Prevents “always empty feedback saved” bug.
* Supports consistent data binding.
* Works without additional JS.
* Makes update predictable.

*Step 4: Keep Feedback Separate from Student Description*

* Student description is read-only display.
* Lecturer feedback is editable input.
* Prevents mixing student text with lecturer comments.
* Keeps integrity of original request submission.
* Ensures lecturer doesn’t accidentally change student message.
* Matches requirement: lecturer adds decision comments, not editing student request.

*Step 5: UI Styling for Feedback Area*

* Add CSS for textarea width=100%, padding, border radius.
* Ensure it fits inside modal on different screen sizes.
* Ensure it scrolls if long.
* Ensure focus style is visible.
* Maintain consistent look with rest of dashboard design.
* Avoid tiny input area complaints.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03hko:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93388,BSSEF25T9-162,Lecturer – Add Decision Comments / Feedback,Done,10/Jan/26 11:24 AM

* Lecturer must be able to write text explanation.
* Feedback must persist in database, not only displayed on screen.
* Feedback must be linked to exactly one request.
* Feedback must be visible when request is reopened.
* Feedback supports both approval and rejection.
* Feedback supports “Needs Info” instructions.

*Step 2: Add Field in StudentRequest Model*

* Added {{lecturer_feedback = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)}}.
* Allows empty values to avoid migration default issues.
* Supports multi-line text in UI.
* Does not limit to 255 characters like CharField.
* Keeps field readable and simple.
* Ensures it stores full reasoning.

*Step 3: Apply Migration*

* Run makemigrations and migrate after adding field.
* Handle rename prompt if Django detects old name (e.g., feedback → lecturer_feedback).
* Confirm migration applied successfully.
* Avoid schema mismatch that causes runtime errors.
* Confirm DB table now includes lecturer_feedback column.
* Confirm no default required issues.

*Step 4: Confirm Field Works in Shell*

* Open Django shell and query StudentRequest objects.
* Assign feedback string and save.
* Reload object and confirm field holds text.
* Confirms DB schema correct.
* Confirms persistence works.
* Prevents “feedback not saved” bug later.

*Step 5: Ensure populate.py supports feedback*

* populate.py can optionally add sample feedback to approved/rejected requests.
* Makes UI demo richer (shows real feedback stored).
* Lets lecturer see “previous decisions” in dashboard.
* Helps test that field renders correctly in templates.
* Confirms system works across different statuses.
* Confirms no crashes due to null feedback.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03hkg:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93388,BSSEF25T9-162,Lecturer – Add Decision Comments / Feedback,Done,10/Jan/26 11:24 AM

* Decision buttons are clearly separated and labeled.
* Colors reduce lecturer confusion.
* Action area is always visible within modal footer.
* Not hidden inside collapsible areas.
* Keeps UI consistent with dashboard style.
* Supports fast decision workflow.

*Step 2: Confirm Before Decision (Optional)*

* Prototype can include JS confirm prompts.
* “Are you sure?” confirm reduces wrong clicks.
* Not required, but can be included easily.
* Keeps user from accidental reject.
* Aligns with real system expectations.
* Good for final demo improvement.

*Step 3: Show decision on same page*

* After redirect, user sees updated badge state.
* This is the “confirmation” that the system processed action.
* Lecturer can reopen modal to verify saved state.
* Helps build trust in the system.
* Prevents repeated clicking.
* Makes the workflow complete.

*Step 4: Handle missing CSS/JS*

* If CSS missing, UI becomes tiny and ugly (we fixed by static paths).
* If JS missing, modal might not open or stays loading.
* Project ensures static served via correct app static folder.
* Uses {{{% load static %}}} and correct static URLs.
* Verified by runserver log no 404.
* Ensures stable lecturer experience.

*Step 5: Maintain Consistency Between List and Details*

* Status values are the same across list badge and modal badge.
* Request type and student info displayed consistently.
* Request id displayed consistently.
* Feedback shown in detail view is the same text saved.
* Prevents mismatched data confusion.

* Backend receives request id.
* Queries StudentRequest object by id.
* If object doesn’t exist, returns safe error or redirect.
* Prevents server crash due to invalid id.
* Ensures only valid requests are updated.
* Makes decision action stable.

*Step 2: Validate Allowed Status Values*

* Backend checks action value is one of: approved/rejected/needs_info.
* Avoids corrupt data saved to DB.
* Keeps status consistent with frontend badge mapping.
* Prevents CSS class mismatch errors.
* Ensures filtering remains correct.
* Ensures later analytics would be possible.

*Step 3: Persist Status and Timestamp*

* Writes new status to DB.
* Saves the record using {{.save()}}.
* created_at stays unchanged (original submission time).
* Decision time can be added later (optional), not required now.
* Ensures SQLite table remains consistent.
* Confirms immediate persistence.

*Step 4: Feedback Optional Save*

* Reads lecturer_feedback from POST.
* Saves it into DB field.
* Keeps it tied to the same request record.
* Allows feedback to be blank but supports full explanation.
* Ensures data is retrievable from dashboard detail later.
* Supports assignment requirement “write down feedback”.

*Step 5: Redirect Flow*

* Redirects back to dashboard.
* Prevents double-submission by refresh.
* Keeps user experience simple.
* Lets lecturer continue with next request.
* Allows filter retention as an enhancement (optional).
* Makes workflow consistent and easy to demo.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03hc8:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93387,BSSEF25T9-161,Lecturer – Approve or Reject a Request,Done,10/Jan/26 11:23 AM

* Approve button is visible inside the request modal.
* Button label clearly says “Approve”.
* Button uses green color styling.
* Button submits decision to backend with action=approved.
* Button located in action area so lecturer doesn’t scroll to find it.
* Button is available for all statuses (prototype), but meaningful for pending.

*Step 2: Provide Reject Button*

* Reject button is visible next to Approve.
* Button label clearly says “Reject”.
* Button uses red styling to avoid confusion.
* Button submits decision to backend with action=rejected.
* Button gives lecturer complete control as required by assignment.
* Button updates DB record so request leaves pending filter.

*Step 3: Provide Needs Info Button*

* Needs Info button supports “request not complete yet” workflow.
* Button label says “Needs Info”.
* Button uses blue styling.
* Button updates status to needs_info.
* Keeps request in a waiting state instead of rejecting.
* Supports lecturer logic: “missing info, send back”.

*Step 4: Connect Buttons to Form Submission*

* Buttons exist inside {{<form method=""post"">}}.
* Includes CSRF token to satisfy Django security requirements.
* Includes hidden input with request primary key.
* Includes hidden input with action string.
* Submits to a decision endpoint in Django URLs.
* Ensures update works reliably even without heavy JS.

*Step 5: Confirm UI Shows Updated Result*

* After decision, lecturer is redirected to dashboard.
* Badge color updates in the list.
* Filter behavior changes (pending view hides approved/rejected).
* Lecturer can verify by switching filter to approved/rejected.
* Ensures decision process is not “fake UI”.
* Confirms DB write was successful.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03hc0:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93387,BSSEF25T9-161,Lecturer – Approve or Reject a Request,Done,10/Jan/26 11:23 AM

* After decision, dashboard status badge reflects new status.
* Badge color changes immediately after reload.
* The same status is displayed in modal when reopened.
* Prevents inconsistency between list view and detail view.
* Helps lecturer confirm their action was saved.
* Makes the system feel “real” and correct.

*Step 2: Feedback Display*

* After feedback submission, reopened modal shows saved feedback text.
* Confirms DB write succeeded.
* Allows lecturer to update feedback later if needed.
* Keeps a clear record of lecturer reasoning.
* Prevents the complaint: “I typed feedback but it disappeared”.
* Makes it demonstrable in project presentation.

*Step 3: Filter Interaction After Changes*

* If lecturer filters by “pending”, approved requests disappear from that view.
* This matches real workflow behavior (completed requests leave pending list).
* Lecturer can switch filter to “approved” to see them again.
* Confirms filtering logic works with live data.
* Supports real review workflow.
* Reinforces correctness of backend + UI integration.

*Step 4: Modal Close and Workflow*

* Modal closes after action submit (by redirect).
* Lecturer returns to dashboard, sees updated request state.
* Prevents staying in stale modal with outdated values.
* Avoids double-clicking buttons because lecturer thinks nothing happened.
* Keeps a clear and simple flow.
* Matches typical admin dashboard UX.

*Step 5: Error Feedback (Basic)*

* If request update fails, Django shows debug error in DEBUG mode.
* During demo, you can keep DEBUG True to see stack traces.
* In production, you’d show friendly messages (not implemented here).
* Still, our project keeps errors visible for developer troubleshooting.
* Ensures problems can be fixed quickly.
* Keeps development consistent with assignment environment.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03hbs:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93378,BSSEF25T9-160,Lecturer – Open and Review Request Details,Done,10/Jan/26 11:23 AM

* Added a Django view function to handle decision submissions.
* View receives request primary key and intended action.
* Uses {{POST}} so decisions aren’t made via insecure GET.
* Validates the request exists before updating.
* If request not found, returns error or redirects safely.
* Keeps logic server-side to ensure DB updates correctly.

*Step 2: Update Status Field*

* If action=approve → set status “approved”.
* If action=reject → set status “rejected”.
* If action=needs_info → set status “needs_info”.
* Ensures status value matches Django choices exactly.
* Saves the model instance after modification.
* Guarantees status badge updates in dashboard.

*Step 3: Store Lecturer Feedback*

* Reads textarea value from POST (e.g., {{lecturer_feedback}}).
* Stores feedback in {{StudentRequest.lecturer_feedback}}.
* Allows empty feedback but encourages lecturer to write explanation.
* Keeps feedback tied to that request record permanently in SQLite.
* Updates can overwrite previous feedback if lecturer edits and resubmits.
* Ensures feedback appears next time request is opened.

*Step 4: Redirect Back to Dashboard*

* After updating, redirect to {{/}} (dashboard).
* Preserves filters if they exist (optional: include query params).
* Ensures the lecturer sees result immediately.
* Avoids double form submission issues on refresh.
* Keeps workflow simple for demo/assignment.
* Works cleanly in server-rendered template approach.

*Step 5: Protect Against Invalid Actions*

* Checks action is one of allowed values only.
* If action invalid, do not update DB.
* Return error message or fallback redirect.
* Prevents broken status values that would break badge styling.
* Ensures system remains stable even if someone manipulates the request.
* Keeps predictable workflow states.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03hbk:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93378,BSSEF25T9-160,Lecturer – Open and Review Request Details,Done,10/Jan/26 11:23 AM

* Modal includes a “Student Information” block.
* Displays student name and student ID clearly.
* Uses labels like “Student Name:” and “Student ID:” to avoid ambiguity.
* Keeps student info separated visually from request details.
* Helps lecturer verify the request belongs to correct student.
* Uses consistent typography and spacing.

*Step 2: Request Details Section*

* Shows request type (Leave Request / Certificate Request).
* Shows description in full (not truncated).
* Shows created_at (submission date) formatted cleanly.
* Shows current status with same badge colors as dashboard list.
* Shows request_id (REQ-001) clearly for referencing in reports.
* Ensures lecturer sees “whole information” required by assignment.

*Step 3: Attachment Section (If Present)*

* Modal displays attachments list if attachments exist.
* If no attachments exist, display “No attachments uploaded.”
* Keeps section visible even if empty to match specification.
* Attachment items show file name and placeholder link (if serving is implemented).
* Attachment model supports linking attachments to requests.
* Designed so later you can upgrade to actual download serving.

*Step 4: Lecturer Feedback Section*

* Shows an input area (textarea) for lecturer feedback.
* Pre-fills existing feedback if request already has feedback.
* Provides clear label: “Lecturer Feedback”.
* Allows lecturer to type the reason / comment for decision.
* Keeps feedback within same modal so workflow is complete.
* Prevents losing input by storing on submit.

*Step 5: Action Buttons Area*

* Modal includes buttons: Approve / Reject / Needs Info.
* Buttons are clearly colored and labeled.
* Buttons trigger backend update (POST) or JS form submit.
* After action, UI refreshes to show updated status in list.
* Prevents lecturer from “only viewing” without being able to decide.
* Matches your exact requirement: “decide accept/reject + write feedback”.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03hbc:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93378,BSSEF25T9-160,Lecturer – Open and Review Request Details,Done,10/Jan/26 11:23 AM

* Each request card includes a View button.
* Button includes the request primary key or request_id in a {{data-*}} attribute.
* Button is visually consistent across cards.
* Button sits in card header so lecturer can find it quickly.
* Button does not navigate away from dashboard (uses modal).
* Button triggers JavaScript to open modal and inject details.

*Step 2: Store Full Request Data for JS*

* Either attach needed fields to {{data-*}} attributes on the card/button,
OR provide a lightweight JSON endpoint (if implemented).
* For prototype simplicity, fields like student name, id, type, status, dates are included.
* Avoids extra page navigation and keeps UX fast.
* Ensures modal has all info without “Loading…” stuck.
* If any field is missing, JS should still show modal with what exists.
* Keeps implementation stable for lecturer demo.

*Step 3: Confirm Request Selection*

* When lecturer clicks View, JS identifies which request was clicked.
* JS reads the request’s stored attributes and maps them to modal fields.
* Ensures correct request information appears (not always the first request).
* Ensures modal title updates with request id.
* Ensures status badge updates to match selected request.
* Ensures modal opens only after data is ready.

*Step 4: Modal Open / Close Behavior*

* Modal is hidden by default ({{display:none}}).
* Clicking View adds {{.open}} class to modal so it displays as flex overlay.
* Close button removes {{.open}}.
* Clicking outside modal content can also close it (optional).
* Prevent scrolling background when modal open (optional improvement).
* Ensures modal does not break layout on small screens.

*Step 5: Avoid Duplicate CSS Rules*

* Removed duplicated modal CSS definitions like:
{{.modal { display:none }}} repeated multiple times.
* Ensures {{.modal.open}} is the only place that enables display.
* Prevents modal not opening because CSS conflicts.
* Maintains one authoritative modal style block.
* Keeps UI consistent across browsers.
* Makes debugging easier (single source of truth).",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03hb4:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93378,BSSEF25T9-160,Lecturer – Open and Review Request Details,Done,10/Jan/26 11:23 AM

* populate.py creates multiple Student records with unique student IDs.
* Ensures dashboard shows multiple names, not just a blank list.
* Ensures each request belongs to an actual Student object.
* Uses realistic sample IDs like STU-2024-001 style.
* Allows more test students so filter dropdown has meaningful data.
* Avoids duplicate inserts if script is re-run (or resets DB).

*Step 2: Create Requests*

* populate.py generates multiple StudentRequest entries with different types.
* Includes at least one pending request to match assignment requirements.
* Includes approved/rejected/needs_info to test status filter.
* Adds realistic descriptions (“leave of absence Jan 15-20 due to family emergency”).
* Generates request_id like REQ-001, REQ-002, etc.
* Ensures created_at timestamps exist so ordering works.

*Step 3: Confirm Dashboard Shows Data*

* After migrate + populate, refresh the page at {{/}}.
* Confirm request cards appear with correct student name/id/type/status.
* Confirm filter dropdowns show status options and request type options.
* Confirm count label matches number of displayed requests.
* Confirm empty state only appears when there are truly no results.
* Confirm there are no server errors in terminal.

*Step 4: Confirm Filtering Works*

* Choose a status (pending) and confirm list changes.
* Choose a request type and confirm list changes.
* Combine status + type and confirm only matching entries appear.
* Confirm URL query string updates correctly.
* Confirm dropdown selections remain after reload.
* Confirm “No requests found” works properly when filters eliminate results.

*Step 5: Confirm “View” Exists*

* Each card shows a View button.
* Clicking it should open the modal with full details (implemented in Story 2).
* Confirm request id shown matches database field.
* Confirm status badge consistent between list and detail.
* Confirm UI does not show “Loading…” stuck state (if it does: JS/static not loading).

* Built {{requests/templates/requests/dashboard.html}}.
* Page includes header + filter section + requests list section.
* Loop through requests and display each request as a “card”.
* Each card shows name, student id, status badge, type, short description.
* Included “View” button to open request details.
* Included a hidden modal section that is shown when “View” is clicked.

*Step 2: Request Card Layout*

* Designed {{.request-card}} with structured header and details sections.
* Displayed student name + student ID clearly in card header.
* Displayed status as a badge with class based on status value.
* Displayed request type and creation date as readable “detail rows”.
* Displayed description preview on dashboard for quick context.
* Ensured layout stays readable on desktop and responsive on small screens.

*Step 3: Status Badge Styling*

* Implemented CSS classes: {{.status-pending}}, {{.status-approved}}, {{.status-rejected}}, {{.status-needs_info}}.
* Used strong contrasting colors for quick scanning (pending yellow, rejected red, needs info blue).
* Ensured badge uses consistent padding and rounded style.
* Ensured text uses capitalize formatting.
* Ensured color and background are visible on light theme.
* Ensured status display updates after decision actions (after reload).

*Step 4: Improve Readability (Sizing + Spacing)*

* Increased container width using {{max-width}} and centered layout.
* Used padding in cards and sections so content isn’t cramped.
* Increased base font sizes to avoid “tiny unreadable” UI.
* Added spacing between cards using flex gap.
* Maintained responsive behavior with media queries.
* Ensured typography uses system fonts for clean look.

*Step 5: Static Linking*

* Used {{{% load static %}}} at top of template.
* Linked CSS: {{{% static 'requests/css/style.css' %}}}.
* Linked JS: {{{% static 'requests/js/dashboard.js' %}}}.
* Fixed static 404 by placing files in correct app static directories.

* Implemented {{dashboard()}} inside {{requests/views.py}}.
* Queried all {{StudentRequest}} objects from the database.
* Ordered results by {{-created_at}} (latest first) to match dashboard behavior.
* Built the request_types list by distinct values from the DB for the filter dropdown.
* Passed context variables into template: requests list + request_types + selected filters.
* Ensured view returns HTTP 200 and renders template cleanly.

*Step 2: Filtering by Status*

* Read status filter from query string: {{?status=pending}}.
* If status is set, filtered queryset: {{StudentRequest.objects.filter(status=status)}}.
* Ensured empty filter means “show all”.
* Preserved selected option in the dropdown using template conditions.
* Tested with multiple statuses to confirm correct results show.
* Confirmed “No requests found” message appears when filter returns empty set.

*Step 3: Filtering by Type*

* Read type filter from query string: {{?type=Leave+Request}}.
* Applied filter on {{request_type}} when selected.
* Combined status + type filters together when both are chosen.
* Preserved selection on page reload.
* Ensured request_types dropdown is populated from DB values.
* Validated with different dummy data types (certificate/leave/etc).

*Step 4: Pass Results to Frontend*

* Sent filtered queryset into template variable like {{requests}}.
* Sent count of active requests into template to show “X request(s)”.
* Sent list of request types for dropdown generation.
* Sent selected status/type so UI stays consistent after filtering.
* Avoided heavy logic in template (kept logic in view).
* Confirmed template does not crash if there are zero requests.

*Step 5: Stability Checks*

* Avoided template iterating over None by always sending a queryset.
* Ensured dashboard still loads even if DB is empty (shows empty state).
* Ensured no direct DB calls in template that can crash the page.
* Confirmed errors like missing table are resolved before runtime.
* Confirmed that any future model field change is followed by migrations.

* Request identity field {{request_id}} (human readable like REQ-001).
* Request classification: {{request_type}} (e.g., Leave Request, Certificate Request).
* Request text: {{description}} used in both dashboard snippet + detail view.
* Workflow fields: {{status}} (pending/approved/rejected/needs_info).
* Lecturer decision field: {{lecturer_feedback}} to store final feedback text.

*Step 2: Implement Models in Django ORM*

* Created {{Student}} model to represent student info.
* Created {{StudentRequest}} model containing request metadata + relation to Student.
* Created {{Attachment}} model linked to StudentRequest (even if minimal usage now).
* Used Django field types: CharField/TextField/DateTimeField/ForeignKey.
* Added {{created_at}} field with auto timestamp to show submission date.
* Added choices for status to enforce consistent allowed values.

*Step 3: Relationships and Integrity*

* Linked each {{StudentRequest}} to exactly one Student via ForeignKey.
* Linked each Attachment to exactly one StudentRequest via ForeignKey.
* Set {{on_delete=models.CASCADE}} so attachments disappear if request removed (consistent integrity).
* Ensured requests cannot exist without a student record in DB.
* Kept relationships simple because lecturer assignment/auth not implemented in this prototype.
* Verified Django admin/model imports are correct (no ImportError).

*Step 4: Migration Generation and Application*

* Ran {{python manage.py makemigrations requests}} to generate app migrations.
* Ran {{python manage.py migrate}} to create SQLite tables.
* Fixed migration prompts when Django asked about renames (accepted when appropriate).
* Ensured no non-null fields were added without defaults (or provided defaults when asked).
* Confirmed migration file exists under {{requests/migrations/0001_initial.py}}.
* Validated by seeing “Applying requests.0001_initial… OK”.

*Step 5: Fix Real Errors That Happened*

* Solved “no such table” errors by ensuring migrations existed + were applied.
* Solved “cannot import Student/Attachment” by matching admin imports to actual model names.
* Ensured app name {{requests}} in INSTALLED_APPS points to correct app folder.
* Verified working from the correct directory containing manage.py.
* Re-ran migrate after fixing models until errors disappeared.
* Confirmed DB now contains rows using Django shell queries.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03h9k:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93377,BSSEF25T9-159,Lecturer – View Assigned Student Requests,Done,10/Jan/26 11:21 AM

* Created a Django project folder {{lecturer_system}} using Django project structure.
* Created the app named {{requests}} to hold all request-related logic.
* Ensured the app includes standard Django files ({{views.py}}, {{models.py}}, {{urls.py}}, templates/static folders).
* Confirmed the project runs with {{manage.py runserver}} after Django installation.
* Verified the correct working directory is the one containing {{manage.py}} (inside {{/lecturer_system/}}).
* Ensured {{INSTALLED_APPS}} includes {{""requests""}} so models/templates load correctly.

*Step 2: Configure Settings for Templates + Static Files*

* Added templates configuration so Django can locate {{requests/templates/requests/}}.
* Used Django staticfiles system (AppDirectoriesFinder) to serve static during development.
* Ensured {{STATIC_URL=""/static/""}} is correct.
* Created app static structure: {{requests/static/requests/css/}} and {{requests/static/requests/js/}}.
* Linked CSS and JS from the template using {{{% load static %}}} and {{{% static %}}} paths.
* Fixed 404 static issues by matching exact file names and correct folder nesting.

*Step 3: Configure URLs Routing*

* Added app URLs file {{requests/urls.py}} and connected it to project {{lecturer_system/urls.py}}.
* Routed the dashboard route ({{/}}) to the dashboard view.
* Confirmed the request list page loads successfully at {{http://127.0.0.1:8000/}}.
* Ensured template rendering works without missing template errors.
* Kept URL structure simple because this is a lecturer dashboard prototype.
* Tested routing after each change to avoid silent failures.

*Step 4: Prepare Database (SQLite)*

* Used default SQLite database {{db.sqlite3}} in the project directory.
* Confirmed DB path is correct in settings under {{DATABASES}}.
* Created and applied migrations for the {{requests}} app.
* Verified tables exist by running migrations successfully (no “no such table” errors).
* Ensured the {{requests/migrations/__init__.py}} exists so migrations are recognized.
* Re-applied migrations if app showed “(no migrations)” until fixed.

*Step 5: Add Dummy Data Population Script*

* Created {{populate.py}} in the same folder as {{manage.py}}.
* Script inserts sample Students + StudentRequests to show real cards on the dashboard.
* Ensures multiple statuses exist (pending/approved/rejected/needs_info) for filter testing.
* Prevents empty dashboard by adding records into SQLite.
* Allows re-running populate without breaking (either by clearing old rows or checking duplicates).
* Verified dummy data appears after running: {{python populate.py}}.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03h94:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,93377,BSSEF25T9-159,Lecturer – View Assigned Student Requests,Done,10/Jan/26 11:21 AM

h3. 🔹 What is Optimize Dashboard Load Performance?

*Optimize Dashboard Load Performance* is a system process whose goal is to ensure that the *Student Dashboard* loads quickly, smoothly, and without delays, even when the student has many requests, notifications, and historical records.

The focus of this subtask is on *performance optimization* and delivering a *high-quality user experience*.

----

h2. 🎯 Purpose of Dashboard Optimization in My System

The main objectives of dashboard optimization are:

* Reducing dashboard loading time
* Preventing a feeling of freezing or long waiting
* Improving overall user experience
* Maintaining system stability even with large volumes of data
* Preventing unnecessary server load

----

h2. 🧭 Step 1: Identifying Critical Data for Initial Load

At this stage, the system determines:

* Which data must be loaded immediately
* Which data can be loaded at a later stage

h3. Critical data loaded immediately:

* Student basic information
* Request summary counters
* Current request statuses
* New notifications

h3. Non-critical data:

* Full request history
* Long request lists
* Secondary or optional information

📌 This approach allows the dashboard to load quickly even when large amounts of data exist.

----

h2. ⚡ Step 2: Progressive Loading (Lazy Loading)

The system loads data gradually:

* The dashboard layout is displayed immediately
* Secondary sections are loaded in the background
* Data is fetched only when needed (e.g., scrolling or clicking)

📌 *Example:*
The full request list is loaded only when the student opens it.

----

h2. 📊 Step 3: Reducing the Amount of Displayed Data

The system limits:

* The number of requests shown on the dashboard (for example, the last five requests)
* The number of initial notifications displayed

This helps to:

* Avoid information overload
* Maintain fast response times
* Display only relevant information

----

h2. 🔄 Step 4: Using Caching Mechanisms

The system uses caching for:

* Data that does not change frequently
* Summary information
* Student profile data

📌 As a result:

* Repeated server requests are avoided
* Dashboard loading time is significantly reduced

----

h2. 🔌 Step 5: Efficient Server Calls (API Optimization)

At this stage:

* Server calls are consolidated
* Duplicate requests are eliminated
* Each API call returns only the required data

📌 Fewer server calls result in faster dashboard loading.

----

h2. 🖥️ Step 6: User Feedback During Loading

To improve user experience:

* A loader or skeleton UI is displayed
* Messages such as _“Loading data…”_ are shown
* The screen is never left empty

📌 The student clearly understands that the system is processing the request.

----

h2. 🔒 Step 7: Maintaining Security During Optimization

Even while optimizing performance:

* Only data belonging to the logged-in student is loaded
* No sensitive data is exposed
* No unauthorized data is preloaded

----

h2. 🧠 Why Is This an Important Part of My System?

Because it:

* Significantly improves usability
* Makes the system feel professional and responsive
* Reduces user complaints
* Supports future system scalability
* Maintains stability under high load

----

h2. 📝 Short and Clear Summary

*Optimize Dashboard Load Performance* ensures that the Student Dashboard loads quickly and efficiently by using progressive loading, data reduction, caching, and optimized server calls, while maintaining strong security and a smooth user experience.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03blc:,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,91617,BSSEF25T9-57,Student – View Homepage Dashboard,Done,01/Jan/26 11:13 AM

----

h2. 🔹 What Is Validate Editable Fields?

*Validate Editable Fields* is a step in my system that ensures *all profile fields the student is allowed to edit contain valid, complete, and secure information before saving changes*.

The goal is to prevent:

* Incorrect data
* Invalid formats
* Security issues
* Data inconsistency

----

h2. 🎯 Purpose of the Validation Step

The main purposes are to:

* Maintain high data quality in my system
* Prevent user input errors
* Protect against invalid or malicious input
* Ensure a clear and reliable user experience

----

h2. 🧭 Step 1: Identify Editable Fields

At this stage, my system identifies all fields the student is allowed to edit, for example:

* Full Name
* Phone Number
* Email
* Address
* Preferred Language
* Password (if applicable)

----

h2. 🧪 Step 2: Required Field Validation

My system checks that:

* Required fields are not empty
* No essential field is left without a value

📌 Example:

* Full Name and Email must be provided

If a required field is empty:

* An error message is displayed
* Saving is not allowed

----

h2. ✉️ Step 3: Format Validation

h3. 🔹 Email:

* Contains “@”
* Includes a valid username and domain

h3. 🔹 Phone Number:

* Digits only
* Meets minimum and maximum length requirements

📌 Invalid input → a clear error message is displayed

----

h2. 🔐 Step 4: Password Validation (If Updated)

If the student changes their password:

* Minimum length is enforced
* Password strength is checked (uppercase letter, number, special character)
* New password must match the confirmation password

If requirements are not met:

* The change is rejected
* A detailed error message is shown

----

h2. 🌐 Step 5: Logical and Policy-Based Validation

Additional checks based on my system’s policies:

* Email uniqueness (not used by another user)
* Preferred language must be selected from a predefined list
* Disallowed characters are blocked

----

h2. ⚠️ Step 6: Error Message Display

When an error is detected:

* The message is shown next to the problematic field
* The message is written in clear, user-friendly language
* Saving is blocked until the error is fixed

----

h2. 🔘 Step 7: Save Confirmation

Only when:

* All fields are valid
* No active errors exist

My system allows:

* Clicking *Save Changes*
* Saving the updated data to the database

----

h2. 🔒 Step 8: Security and Logging

After a successful save:

* Data is stored securely
* The change is recorded in the system audit log
* Read-only fields remain unchanged

----

h2. 🧠 Why Is This an Important Part of My System?

Because it:

* Ensures reliable and accurate data
* Prevents future issues
* Improves overall usability
* Strengthens data security

----

h2. 📝 Short and Clear Summary

----

h2. 🔹 What Is Design Profile Edit UI?

*Design Profile Edit UI* refers to the design and structure of a screen where the student can
*view and update their personal account information in a controlled manner*.

This is a *profile management screen*, separate from request-related screens, and it focuses solely on user account details.

h2. 🎯 Purpose of This Screen

The main purposes are to:

* Allow the student to update personal information
* Keep user data up to date in my system
* Separate personal account data from request-related data
* Prevent errors and unauthorized changes

h2. 🧭 Step 1: Accessing the Profile Edit Screen

The student reaches this screen as follows:

# The student logs in to my system
# Navigates to the *Student Dashboard*
# Clicks on one of the following options:
#* *My Profile*
#* *Account Settings*
#* *Edit Profile*
# My system opens the *Profile Edit* screen

h2. 🖥️ Step 2: General Screen Structure (UI Layout)

The screen is divided into clear sections:

* Top header: *Edit Profile*
* Personal information form
* Login / authentication details section
* Action buttons at the bottom

The design is clean, simple, and uncluttered.

h2. 👤 Step 3: Displaying Existing User Information

When the screen loads:

* My system automatically retrieves the student’s data from the database
* All fields are pre-filled with the current values

This allows the student to:

* See what information is currently stored
* Clearly understand which fields can be edited and which cannot

h2. 📋 Step 4: Editable and Read-Only Fields

h3. ✔️ Editable fields:

* Full Name
* Phone Number
* Email (if allowed by system policy)
* Address (if supported by my system)
* Preferred Language (if applicable)

h3. 🔒 Read-only fields:

* Student ID
* Username
* Role (Student)

These fields are locked to protect user identity and system integrity.

h2. 🔐 Step 5: Password Section (If Applicable)

If my system supports password changes, the screen includes:

* Current password field
* New password field
* Confirm new password field

📌 Changing the password requires full validation and authentication.

h2. 🧪 Step 6: Validation and Input Controls

Before saving changes, my system performs:

* Required field validation
* Email format validation
* Password strength validation (if changed)
* Clear error messages displayed next to the relevant fields

No changes are saved if validation fails.

h2. 🔘 Step 7: Action Buttons

At the bottom of the screen:

* *Save Changes* – saves updated information
* *Cancel* – discards changes and returns without saving

h2. 🔁 Step 8: Saving the Data

When the student clicks *Save Changes*:

# My system validates all inputs
# The updated data is saved to the database
# A success confirmation message is displayed
# The student is redirected to the dashboard or remains on the profile screen

h2. 🔒 Step 9: Security and Permissions

* A student can edit *only their own profile*
* No access is allowed to other users’ profiles
* All changes are logged (Audit Log)

h2. 🧠 Why Is This an Important Part of My System?

Because it:

* Keeps user information accurate and up to date
* Improves the overall user experience
* Reduces the need for manual updates by the secretary
* Supports secure and proper user management

h2. 📝 Short and Clear Summary

*Design Profile Edit UI* is a screen that allows a student to view and update personal account information in a secure and controlled way.

As a staff member, I can add notes or request additional documents                                            When reviewing a request, the administrative staff member may notice points that require clarification, correction, or additional information. Using the system, the staff member adds notes directly to the request. These notes are linked to the request, visible to authorized users, and help ensure accurate processing and proper documentation.

The notes can include instructions, comments about missing or unclear data, or any observation that the Head of Department or other staff should be aware of. The system records all added notes to maintain accountability and traceability.

----

h3. *Frontend* 

The staff member interacts with the request through the system interface:

* *HTML:* To structure the request pages and display all existing details, attachments, and notes clearly.
* *CSS:* To style the notes section and ensure that the interface is organized, readable, and user-friendly.
* *JavaScript:* To enable interactivity, such as typing new notes, saving them, and validating inputs before submission.

The Frontend allows the staff to review the request thoroughly and add notes efficiently

----

h3. *Backend* 

The system processes the notes and links them to the request:

* *Python / Java / PHP (or similar languages):* To handle adding, saving, and updating notes in the system, ensuring they are associated with the correct request.
* The Backend also ensures data integrity, validates the notes, and maintains any relevant metadata (date, time, and staff member who added the notes).

This ensures that all notes are processed reliably and stored securely for future review.

----

h3. *Database*

All notes are stored in the database along with the request details:

* Notes text, linked to the specific request
* Metadata such as staff member ID, date, and time
* Attachments or references mentioned in the notes

The database ensures that notes are permanently recorded, traceable, and available for auditing or follow-up.",,Marwa Abu-Rabia,712020:f7136f6b-ac50-47ca-aa26-bd06af11e954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,1|i03b33:r,BSSEF25T Sprint 1,,,,,,92516,BSSEF25T9-152,Request Review and Processing,In Progress,13/Jan/26 11:58 AM

----

h2. 🔹 What Is This Section in My System?

*Test Historical Data Consistency* is a validation principle in my system that ensures *all historical data related to a request is preserved and displayed consistently, accurately, and reliably over time*.

This means:

* What the student saw yesterday is exactly what they will see today
* Historical data does not change retroactively
* There are no inconsistencies between statuses, dates, notes, and documents

h2. 🎯 Purpose of This Section

The main purposes of this section are to:

* Ensure full reliability of request data
* Prevent modification or deletion of existing history
* Maintain a clear and continuous record of the handling process
* Allow the student to trust the information displayed in the system

h2. 🧭 What Is Verified as Part of Test Historical Data Consistency?

This validation focuses on several key components:

h3. 1️⃣ Status Consistency

The system verifies that:

* Every status change is recorded
* The chronological order is correct
* There are no illogical transitions between statuses

📌 Examples:

* An “Approved” status cannot appear before “In Progress”
* A status cannot disappear from the history

h3. 2️⃣ Date and Time Consistency

The system verifies that:

* Every status has an associated date and time
* Dates and times match the order of actions
* The submission date never changes

📌 From the student’s perspective:

* The submission date remains constant
* Update timestamps remain exactly as recorded

h3. 3️⃣ Notes Consistency

The system verifies that:

* Notes added by the secretary or department head are not altered
* Notes cannot be deleted or edited retroactively
* Each note is linked to the correct status and timestamp

h3. 4️⃣ Documents Consistency

The system verifies that:

* Every uploaded document is preserved
* No documents disappear from the request history
* Each document is linked to the correct request and upload date

h3. 5️⃣ Consistency Across Different Screens

The system verifies that:

* The same information is displayed consistently across:
** The Student Dashboard
** The Request Details page
** The Secretary and Lecturer views

📌 The student, secretary, and lecturer all see *the same historical record* of the request.

h2. 🔒 What Can the Student _Not_ Do in This Context?

* ❌ Edit historical records
* ❌ Delete statuses
* ❌ Change dates or timestamps
* ❌ Modify past notes or documents

The request history is *final and immutable*.

h2. 🔁 Connection to the Overall System Flow

This principle integrates into the overall process as follows:

# The student submits a request
# Every action is recorded as historical data
# The secretary and lecturer update statuses and notes
# All updates are permanently stored
# The student views a consistent and reliable history

h2. 🧠 Why Is This an Important Part of My System?

Because it:

* Prevents disputes about “what happened and when”
* Builds trust between the student and the system
* Enables auditing and post-review
* Strengthens the academic and administrative credibility of the system

h2. 📝 Short and Clear Summary

*Test Historical Data Consistency* ensures that all historical request data—statuses, dates, notes, and documents—is stored in a consistent, accurate, and immutable manner.

h2. 🔹 What Is This Section in My System?

*Ensure Read-Only Access for Students* is a system principle that ensures that *after a request is submitted*, the student has *view-only access* to all request details.

This means:

* The student can *view* the information
* But *cannot modify* it

This principle is designed to maintain order, reliability, and control throughout the process.

h2. 🎯 Purpose of This Section

The main purposes of this section are to:

* Prevent data changes after submission
* Preserve data integrity

** Attach or remove documents
** Select request priority

h3. 🔸 After Submitting the Request:

* All fields are locked
* The request enters *Read-Only mode*

h2. 🖥️ How Is This Reflected on the Page?

After submission:

h3. 🔹 Text Fields

* Displayed as non-editable
* No text cursor is shown

h3. 🔹 Selection Lists (Dropdowns)

* Locked
* Displayed in read-only mode

h3. 🔹 Documents

* Available for viewing and downloading only
* Cannot be deleted or replaced

h3. 🔹 Action Buttons

* Edit buttons are removed or disabled
* Only view-related actions remain

h2. 🔒 What Can the Student _Not_ Do?

After submission, the student:

* ❌ Cannot edit request details
* ❌ Cannot change the priority
* ❌ Cannot add or remove documents
* ❌ Cannot change the request status

h2. 🔁 Connection to the Overall System Flow

This principle integrates into the overall process as follows:

# The student completes the request form
# The student submits the request
# My system locks the request for editing
# The secretary and lecturer process the request
# The student tracks the request in read-only mode

h2. 🧠 Why Is This an Important Part of My System?

Because it:

* Prevents uncontrolled data changes
* Ensures all parties view the same information
* Preserves the integrity of the approval process
* Avoids disputes or ambiguity

h2. 📝 Short and Clear Summary
